    Hi, I am Luis Martinez. I live in Herriman, Utah, and I am a father of four—two boys (16 and 6) and two girls (12 and
    8). They keep life busy and meaningful. I am a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I
    served a full-time mission and now do my best to stay close to the gospel by attending the temple weekly—often with my
    kids—and being active in my ward.
    
    After years of running my own business and working in customer success and support, I stepped away to focus on some
    personal and family challenges. Now I am back in school, working to finish the degree I started years ago when my career
    took off. It is a humbling and hopeful experience to be a student again, and I am looking forward to learning and
    growing through this web development course.

    <h2>Utah</h2>
    <img src="images/utah.jpeg" alt="Utah State Outline">  
    <p>Utah is a beautiful state with red rock deserts, snowy mountains, and famous parks like Zion. It’s great for outdoor
    fun, has deep history, and values family and community. A unique and welcoming place to live or visit.
